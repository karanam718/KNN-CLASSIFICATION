# KNN-CLASSIFICATION

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is a non-parametric and instance-based learning algorithm where the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space.

How it works:
Training Phase:
KNN stores all available data points and their classifications.
Prediction Phase:
For a new data point, KNN finds the k nearest neighbors (closest data points) in the training data based on a chosen distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
The predicted class for the new data point is determined by majority vote among its k nearest neighbors.
Key Parameters:
K: Number of nearest neighbors to consider. A smaller k means the model is more sensitive to noise, while a larger k smooths out the decision boundary.
Distance Metric: Measure used to calculate distance between data points (e.g., Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance).
Advantages:
Simple to implement and understand.
No training phase, as the algorithm stores all training data.
Effective for multi-class classification.
Disadvantages:
Computationally expensive during prediction for large datasets.
Requires a meaningful distance metric for the problem domain.
Sensitive to irrelevant or redundant features.
Usage:
Data: KNN can handle both numerical and categorical data but requires feature scaling for numerical features.
Performance: Effective for smaller datasets with fewer dimensions compared to high-dimensional data.
